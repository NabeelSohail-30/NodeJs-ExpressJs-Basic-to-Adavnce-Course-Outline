# Project Ideas

- Todo List Application - Create a simple todo list application where users can add, update, and delete tasks. You can use a database to store the tasks and use CRUD operations to handle the data.

- Image Gallery - Build an image gallery application that allows users to upload and view images. You can use a database to store the images and use middleware to handle file uploads.

- Blog Application - Build a blog application where users can create, edit, and delete blog posts. You can use a database to store the blog posts and use templates to display them.

- Weather App - Create a weather application that allows users to search for the weather of a city. You can use a weather API to fetch the weather data and display it on your application.

- Chat Application - Build a real-time chat application using WebSockets and Socket.io. Users can join different chat rooms and send messages to each other.

- E-commerce Application - Build an e-commerce application where users can browse products, add them to cart, and checkout. You can use a database to store the products and user information.

- Authentication and Authorization - Build an authentication and authorization system where users can sign up, login, and access their account. You can use Passport.js to handle authentication and role-based access control.

- RESTful API - Build a RESTful API that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a resource. You can use middleware to handle authentication and validation.

# Conclusion:
By the end of this course, students will have a deep understanding of Node.js and Express and be able to build complex web applications. They will also have experience with building RESTful APIs, integrating with databases, and implementing authentication and authorization. The knowledge gained from this course will enable students to create web applications that are scalable, secure, and efficient.
